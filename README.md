# 📊 Linear Regression from Scratch with NumPy

A simple, beginner-friendly implementation of **Linear Regression** using only **NumPy** and pure Python — no machine learning libraries involved! 


---

## 💡 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Implement Linear Regression using **gradient descent**
- Evaluate model performance with **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- Visualize predictions vs. actual data using **matplotlib**

Useful for students, interview prep, and anyone who wants to understand how ML algorithms work behind the scenes.
